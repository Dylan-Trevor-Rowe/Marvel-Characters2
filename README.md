# Marvel-Characters
 This project is an adventure into the world of Marvel Characters. Depending on which button you click, it will 
 print cards from a different marvel group. It utilizes ES6 array methods to help filter the characters by Team, as well as changes the color of the image border to pink if the character is female or blue if the character is male. If the characters did not have a decription dummy data was filterd in.
